sas.py is a program designed to convert "human-readable SCRAM" into "machine-readable SCRAM".
In other words, it is an assembler that takes code and turns it into bytes that are then
run by the scram.py program. The dis.py program takes byte data and turns it back into readable
code. In general, a sample code line should be in the format "label: OPCODE address     #comment".
The OPCODEs include the ones on the slides as well as DAT, which means that the address is
actually a 4-bit integer. To read the actual bytes output, use xxd output.scram.

To run sas.py:
    python3 sas.py input.s > output.scram
